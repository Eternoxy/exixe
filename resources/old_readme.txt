exixe module and clock board:

GPS calibrated clock @ nanosecond accruacy
* SPI interface
* Modular: you can use as many or as little as you need
* Low-cost: No need to track down vintage high voltage driver chips that has been out of production for 30 years.

Measuring only 2cm x 4cm, each of those tiny boards uses an STM32 to drive one Nixie tube. All digits and dots have hardware PWM for silky smooth dimming and animations, and each module is controlled via standard SPI interface, available on Arduino and Raspberry Pi (and virtually all embedded systems today).
