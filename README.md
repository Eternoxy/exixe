Thanks to this diode, when an EMC stress oc
curs, the level of the noise is clamped to V
DD
. 
As a consequence, channels implemented on FT I/O show a better noise immunity

ref-packages

find smt 8MHz and 32.768KHz crystals

remove tx rx header put backing transistors there

remove eeprom 
put pf0 pf1 tx rx on test points

change drc will change pad size

eixie reset after a short delay when invalid header
gps fix led

polygon rank higher will isolate lower

use driven shield, no ground or signal underneath

test reversed tx rx

test rtos

looks like reset is needed for correct SPI snyc
