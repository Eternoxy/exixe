exixe is a driver module for IN-12 and IN-14 Nixie tubes, I developed them while building my own Nixie clock. 

## Features

Compared to the traditional approach, exixe board offers significant advantages:

#### Small and modular
* 2x4 cm (0.79x1.57 inches)
* Breadboard friendly
* Easy integration

#### Low-cost
* $3 in components
* No need for obscure vintage driver chips

#### SPI interface
* High speed, up to 8MHz SCLK
* Available on virtually all embedded systems including Arduino and Raspberry Pi
* Simple 16-byte command packet

#### Advanced control
* Powered by STM32
* Hardware PWM on all cathodes for silky smooth dimming and animations
* Overdrive feature for poisoned cathodes

#### RGB backlit
* ...well because RGB
